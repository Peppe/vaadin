            Vaadin is an AJAX web application development framework that enables
            developers to build high-quality user interfaces with Java, both on the
            server- and client-side. It provides a set of libraries of ready-to-use user
            interface components and a clean framework for creating your own
            components. The focus is on ease-of-use, re-usability, extensibility, and
            meeting the requirements of large enterprise applications.
