= Using Vaadin with Maven

((("Maven", "creating a project", id="term.maven.creating", range="startofrange")))


Maven is a commonly used build and dependency management system. The Vaadin core
library and all Vaadin add-ons are available through Maven. You can use a Maven
with a front-end from Eclipse or NetBeans, or by using the command-line as
described in this section.

In addition to regular Maven, you can use any Maven-compatible build or
dependency management system, such as Ivy or Gradle. For Gradle, see the
link:https://github.com/johndevs/gradle-vaadin-plugin[Gradle Vaadin Plugin].
Vaadin Plugin for Eclipse uses Ivy for resolving dependencies in Vaadin
projects, and it should provide you with the basic Ivy configuration.

[[getting-started.maven.command-line]]
== Working from Command-Line

You can create a new Maven project with the following command (given in one
line):

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#mvn# archetype:generate \
   -DarchetypeGroupId=com.vaadin \
   -DarchetypeArtifactId=[parameter]#vaadin-archetype-application# \
   -DarchetypeVersion=[replaceable]#7.x.x# \
   -DgroupId=[replaceable]#your.company# \
   -DartifactId=[replaceable]#project-name# \
   -Dversion=[replaceable]#0.1# \
   -Dpackaging=war
----
The parameters are as follows:

[parameter]#archetypeGroupId#:: The group ID of the archetype is [literal]#++com.vaadin++# for Vaadin
archetypes.

[parameter]#archetypeArtifactId#:: The archetype ID. Vaadin 7 currently supports
[literal]#++vaadin-archetype-application++# archetype for server-side
applications and [literal]#++vaadin-archetype-widget++# for client-side widget
development projects.

+
//TODO Vaadin 7: Not all these archetypes are supported
+
////
&lt;itemizedlist&gt; &lt;listitem&gt; &lt;literal&gt;vaadin-archetype-clean&lt;/literal&gt; is a new project with a barebone skeleton for a regular Vaadin application. The &lt;filename&gt;pom.xml&lt;/filename&gt; includes out-commented definitions for additional widgets. &lt;/listitem&gt; &lt;/itemizedlist&gt; &lt;itemizedlist&gt; &lt;listitem&gt; &lt;literal&gt;vaadin-archetype-widget&lt;/literal&gt; is a skeleton for a project with custom widgets. &lt;/listitem&gt; &lt;/itemizedlist&gt; &lt;itemizedlist&gt; &lt;listitem&gt; &lt;literal&gt;vaadin-archetype-sample&lt;/literal&gt; is also for a project with custom widgets, but the skeleton includes the Color Picker example used in &lt;xref linkend="gwt"/&gt;. &lt;/listitem&gt; &lt;/itemizedlist&gt; &lt;itemizedlist&gt; &lt;listitem&gt; &lt;literal&gt;vaadin-archetype-addon&lt;/literal&gt; is for Vaadin add-on projects. It packages the add-on so that it can be published in Vaadin Directory. The archetype is for server-side add-ons and does not include definitions needed for building a widget set. If your add-on includes or requires other than the widgets in the Vaadin core library, you need to copy the required definitions from a POM of a &lt;literal&gt;vaadin-archetype-clean&lt;/literal&gt; project. &lt;/listitem&gt; &lt;/itemizedlist&gt; &lt;itemizedlist&gt; &lt;listitem&gt; &lt;literal&gt;vaadin-archetype-touchkit&lt;/literal&gt; is for projects using Vaadin TouchKit, described in &lt;xref linkend="mobile"/&gt;. Notice that this archetype uses the AGPL-licensed version of TouchKit, which requires that your project must also be licensed under the AGPL license. &lt;/listitem&gt; &lt;/itemizedlist&gt;
////
[parameter]#archetypeVersion#:: Version of the archetype to use. This should be [literal]#++LATEST++# for normal
Vaadin releases. For prerelease versions it should be the exact version number,
such as [literal]#++7.5.3++#.

[parameter]#groupId#:: A Maven group ID for your project. It is normally your organization domain name
in reverse order, such as com.example. The group ID is also used as a prefix for
the Java package in the sources, so it should be Java compatible - only
alphanumerics and an underscore.

[parameter]#artifactId#:: Identifier of the artifact, that is, your project. The identifier may contain
alphanumerics, minus, and underscore. It is appended to the group ID to obtain
the Java package name for the sources. For example, if the group ID is
com.example and artifact ID is myproject, the project sources would be placed in
com.example.myproject package.

[parameter]#version#:: Initial version number of your application. The number must obey the Maven
version numbering format.

[parameter]#packaging#:: How will the project be packaged. It is normally [literal]#++war++#.



Creating a project can take a while as Maven fetches all the dependencies. The
created project structure is shown in
<<figure.getting-started.maven.archetype.created>>.

[[getting-started.maven.compiling]]
== Compiling and Running the Application

((("Maven", "compiling", id="term.maven.compiling", range="startofrange")))


Before the application can be deployed, it must be compiled and packaged as a
WAR package. You can do this with the [literal]#++package++# goal as follows:

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#mvn# package
----
The location of the resulting WAR package should be displayed in the command
output. You can then deploy it to your favorite application server.

The easiest way to run Vaadin applications with Maven is to use the light-weight
Jetty web server. After compiling the package, all you need to do is type:

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#mvn# jetty:run
----
The special goal starts the Jetty server in port 8080 and deploys the
application. You can then open it in a web browser at
http://localhost:8080/project-name.

[[getting-started.maven.addons]]
== Using Add-ons and Custom Widget Sets

((("Maven", "using add-ons", id="term.maven.addons", range="startofrange")))


If you use Vaadin add-ons that include a widget set or make your custom widgets,
you need to enable widget set compilation in the POM. The required configuration
is described in
<<dummy/../../../framework/addons/addons-maven#addons.maven,"Using Add-ons in a
Maven Project">>.
